#### Is MediaLit just a wrapper on top of the AWS S3 API?

No! It offers much more, like ease of use, image optimization, thumbnail creation, etc.

#### Can I build a MediaLit alternative in a weekend, since I am a developer?

You can always try. That said, we've already done all the heavy lifting for you, so you can add file uploads to your app in under 5 minutes. If time is NOT money, knock yourself out.

#### Is the MediaLit OSS crippled in any way?

No! Everything that powers [medialit.cloud](https://medialit.cloud) is contained in our GitHub [repo](https://github.com/codelitdev/medialit).
