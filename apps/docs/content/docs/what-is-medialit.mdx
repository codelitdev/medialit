We believe that adding file uploads should be a no-brainer task for developers.

In reality, the process is quite complex, as devs are supposed to know storage, policies, CDNs, and firewalls in order to build a decent solution.

**Hence, we built MediaLit, where everything has been configured for you. All you need is an API key and some code snippets to add file uploads to your apps.**

## Philosophy

**Batteries included**: In addition to file hosting, modern apps also require other niceties like image optimization, thumbnail generation, etc. So, we have bundled the transformation utilities with the storage API.

**100% Self-hostable**: All parts of the ecosystem have been open-sourced. We have made sure that our docs are always updated and easy to follow. No gimmicks when it comes to being OSS.

**Vendor-agnostic**: We try to stick to using S3 features that are available on most AWS S3-compatible providers. This allows you to easily move to a different vendor if you decide to do so.

## Why MediaLit

We designed MediaLit with simplicity in mind.

Here are a few unique features:
- A simpler API for file hosting than AWS S3.
- Integrated CDN.
- Automatic image optimization (configurable).
- Automatic thumbnail generation for images and videos (configurable).

### Serverless Apps

MediaLit allows you to create pre-signed URLs that can be shared with serverless apps to let them upload files directly from the frontend. No more leaking keys.
