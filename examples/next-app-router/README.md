This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project which demonstrates the usage of `medialit` package.

## Getting Started

First, create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following environment variables:

```env
MEDIALIT_ENDPOINT=https://api.medialit.clqa.site
MEDIALIT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
