# Ownership

MediaLit is divided into two part:

1. The core API `@medialit/api` which is responsible for managing media on a AWS S3 compatible storage.
2. The frontend app `@medialit/app` which is responsible for managing accounts on `@medialit/api`. This includes all the administrative tasks like creating apps, billing, showing statistics etc.
